# Cesium
This project is for creating a 3D web-base spatial viewer 
First, using FEM, I converted my CityGML files into 3D Tiles. Then, using the Cesium framework, I design it in an HTML page. In the next step, I added the capability to display coordinates and the ability to draw as well. I also added an attribute to my model so that when clicked, its details can be viewed (Identify capability).
